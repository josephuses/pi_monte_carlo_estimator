## What does the Pi Monte Carlo Estimator do?

We have learned from geometry that the area of a circle is $\pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle. But how did early mathematicians estimate the value of $\pi$? More importantly, how can you estimate the value of $\pi$? Well, for one, if we know the area of the cirlce and the radius of the circle, we can solve for $\pi$!

This app estimates the value of $\pi$ using Monte Carlo simulation. The idea is that
